🎯 Game Description: Guess the Number

Guess the Number is a simple and fun number-guessing game where players try to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 10. Each time you make a guess, the game tells you whether you’re right or wrong. You start with a score of 10 points — every wrong guess reduces your score by 1. If you guess correctly, you win! But if your score reaches zero, the game ends and you lose.

The game features a colorful gradient background, smooth buttons, and instant feedback that makes playing both engaging and visually appealing.![Uploading image.png…]()
